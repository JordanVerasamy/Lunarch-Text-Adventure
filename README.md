Lunarch Text Adventure
======================

This is an epic story about a young boy overcoming hardships to finally acquire the job of his dreams. It's basically just a finite-state-machine with augmentation at each node. Also, it's totally abstract - no core code needs to be change to make your own text-adventure, only the list of states and state transitions. I mocked this up in about 2.5 hours the night before I interviewed at Lunarch. It's kind of totally awesome.
